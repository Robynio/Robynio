### Hello, hallo, hola, olá! 👋

I am passionate about developing ideas and bring them to code.

While I am also able to make things look good in the frontend, I love to structure and create the backend of things even more.

🤖 Technologies I work with: NODE.js, Express, Mongo-DB, SQL, Passport.js, REACT, Bootstrap... to be expanded soon!

I love to learn and improve my skills on a regular basis: Right now I started to get into cloud computing and working with SQL DB.

🏀 When I am not coding I cook, I hoop or try not to fall off a horse 🐴

I am open to collaborate on coding projects, job offers and sharing experiences in tech!
